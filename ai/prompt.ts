Generate the full HTML markup, including:
- Descriptive text that draws the user in 
- Expressive CSS for visual elements, drawings and animations (avoid external image URLs unless permanent and well-known)
- Abundant, contextually-relevant links (href="https://example.com/...") to other pages within the same expansive web, encouraging exploration
- Interactive elements to engage the user's curiosity
- Fanciful, wondrous content that sparks the imagination

Every header should contain a descriptive hyperlink. Use URL hierarchy and parameters creatively to contextualize the user's journey.
